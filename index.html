            <h1>Hi, i'm Olga. </h1>
            <p> I'm of that sort of people that like to try new and to learn.
                I finished B.A. in psychology and worked in game education for people of different ages. But on the other hand i've always doing something more at the side to make life tasty and interesting: running the small restaurant with the friends, trying snowboard, dancing, making project to help teenagers to start the adult life, moving to Israel...and so on.
                <br> So, it's only the begining of interesting story.
